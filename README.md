## Featured Projects

### [Port Scanner](https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework/blob/main/Port%20Scanner)
An efficient tool designed to scan open ports on a target machine or network. This project leverages Python's `socket` library to identify potential vulnerabilities and improve security posture.

- **Tech Used**: Python, Networking, Socket Programming

#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
   cd Port\ Scanner
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies (if any): 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Run Instructions
1. Run the script: 
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
   ```
2. Provide the target IP or hostname and port range as prompted.
3. Test cases include:
   - Scanning common ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22, 21) on localhost.
   - Scanning a custom port range (e.g., 20-100).
   - Scanning a remote target (e.g., scanme.nmap.org).

### [Socket Connection](https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework/blob/main/Socket%20Connection)
A foundational project demonstrating the establishment of a client-server connection using Python sockets. It includes functionality for secure communication between endpoints.

- **Tech Used**: Python, Networking, Client-Server Architecture

#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
   cd Socket\ Connection
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies (if any): 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Run Instructions
1. Start the server: 
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
2. In a separate terminal, start the client: 
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```
3. Expected behavior:
   - The server listens on localhost and displays incoming connections.
   - The client connects to the server and sends a message (e.g., "Hello, Server").

### [Automation of SCAP Manual Questions](https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework/blob/main/Automation%20of%20SCAP%20Manual%20Questions)
A project to streamline the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) assessment process by automating the handling of manual questionnaires. This tool enhances compliance and efficiency in cybersecurity audits.

- **Tech Used**: Python, Automation, Cybersecurity

#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelly5054/CYB333---Coursework.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
   cd Automation\ of\ SCAP\ Manual\ Questions
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies (if any): 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Run Instructions
1. Run the script: 
   ```bash
   python scap_automation.py
   ```
2. The script executes predefined compliance checks, including:
   - Checking if an antivirus solution is installed and active using PowerShell commands.
   - Listing members of the Administrators group on the system.
   - Evaluating internet access policies for administrative accounts.
   - Verifying if Credential Guard is enabled and running.
   - Checking specific registry keys for compliance.
3. Follow the printed instructions for manual review requirements.
4. Review compliance results directly in the terminal output.
